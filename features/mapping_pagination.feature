Feature: Paginated mappings
  As a GDS'er with an interest in the performance of mappings,
  I would like to see a list of mappings to edit
  so that I can find one to edit

  Scenario: There are no mappings for a site
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a site called bis_lowpay belonging to an organisation bis with these mappings:
      | http_status | path             | new_url           |
    When I visit the path /sites/bis_lowpay
    And I click the link called "Mappings"
    Then I should see the header "0 mappings"
    And the page title should be "Mappings | bis-lowpay.gov.uk | GOV.UK Transition"
    And I should see "0 mappings"

  Scenario: There are mappings for a site and we visit page 1
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a site called bis_lowpay belonging to an organisation bis with these mappings:
      | http_status | path             | new_url             |
      | 410         | /about/corporate |                     |
      | 301         | /a               | http://a.gov.uk/bis |
      | 410         | /something       |                     |
    And the mappings page size is 2
    When I visit the path /sites/bis_lowpay
    And I click the link called "Mappings"
    Then I should see the header "3 mappings"
    And  I should see "bis-lowpay"
    And  I should see a mappings table with 2 rows
    And  I should see 1 as the current page
    And  I should see links top and bottom to page 2

  Scenario: There are mappings for a site and we visit page 2
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a site called bis_lowpay belonging to an organisation bis with these mappings:
      | http_status | path             | new_url             |
      | 410         | /about/corporate |                     |
      | 301         | /a               | http://a.gov.uk/bis |
      | 410         | /something       |                     |
    And the mappings page size is 2
    When I visit the path /sites/bis_lowpay
    And I click the link called "Mappings"
    And I go to page 2
    Then  I should see a mappings table with 1 row
    And  I should see 2 as the current page
    And  I should see links top and bottom to page 1
