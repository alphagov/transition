Feature: Filter mappings
  As a GDS User with an interest in the quality of mappings,
  I want to filter the list of mappings
  so that I can get to the things I need to change faster

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a site called directgov belonging to an organisation directgov with these mappings:
      | http_status | path             | new_url                   | tags             |
      | 410         | /about/corporate |                           | fee, fum, fiddle |
      | 301         | /about/branding  | http://a.gov.uk/branding  | fi, fum          |
      | 301         | /another         | http://a.gov.uk/directgov | fo, fiddle       |
      | 410         | /notinfilter     |                           |                  |
    And I visit the path /sites/directgov/mappings
