Feature: Editing multiple mappings for a site
  As a GDS User,
  I want to update many existing mappings at once
  so that I can efficiently improve the quality of mappings

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a site called directgov belonging to an organisation directgov with these mappings:
      | http_status | path             | new_url                                 |
      | 301         | /a               | http://a.gov.uk/directgov               |
      | 301         | /about/branding  | http://a.gov.uk/branding                |
      | 410         | /about/corporate |                                         |
      | 410         | /z1              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z2              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z3              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z4              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z5              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z6              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z7              |                                         |
      | 410         | /z8              |                                         |
    And I visit the path /sites/directgov/mappings

  Scenario: Selecting multiple mappings to redirect without javascript

    And I should not see a "Redirect to" input
