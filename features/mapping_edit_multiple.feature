Feature: Editing multiple mappings for a site
  As a GDS User,
  I want to update many existing mappings at once
  so that I can efficiently improve the quality of mappings

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And there is a site called directgov belonging to an organisation directgov with these mappings:
      | type       | path             | new_url                        | tags       |
      | redirect   | /a               | http://a.gov.uk/directgov      |            |
      | redirect   | /about/branding  | http://a.gov.uk/branding       |            |
      | archive    | /about/corporate |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z1              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z2              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z3              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z4              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z5              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z6              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z7              |                                |            |
      | archive    | /z8              |                                |            |
      | unresolved | /u0              |                                | unresolved |
      | unresolved | /u1              |                                | unresolved |
    And I visit the path /sites/directgov/mappings
