Feature: Summary traffic for site
  As a GDS transition manager/GDS performance analyst
  I want to see a summary of traffic to a site
  So that I can more easily decide what to fix next based on performance

Background: I start at the summary page
  Given I have logged in as an admin
  And the date is 19/10/12
  And these hits exist for the Attorney General's office site:
    | http_status | path | hit_on   | count |
    | 301         | /    | 17/10/12 | 100   |
    | 301         | /2   | 17/10/12 | 100   |

  When I visit the associated organisation
  And I click the link "Hits Summary"

Scenario: Hits exist and are summarised for a site, displayed with a graph
  Then I should see a section for the most common errors
  And it should show only the top 10 errors in descending count order
  And I should see a section for the most common archives
  And it should show only the top 10 archives in descending count order
  And I should see a section for the most common redirects
  And it should show only the top 10 redirects in descending count order
  And I should see a section for the other hits, the most common miscellany
  And it should show only the top 10 other in descending count order
  And I should see a graph representing hits data over time
  And I should see a trend for all hits, errors, archives and redirects
  When I click a point for the date 18/10/12
  Then I should see a section for the most common errors
  And it should show only the top 9 errors in descending count order
  But I should not see a graph

Scenario: Hits exist and can be filtered by error and time period "Yesterday"
  When I click the link "Errors"
  Then I should see all hits with an error status for the Attorney General's office in descending count order
  And I should see an errors graph showing a red trend line
  When I filter by the date period "Yesterday"
  Then I should see only yesterday's errors in descending count order
  And I should not see a graph
  And the period "Yesterday" should be selected

Scenario: Hits exist and can be filtered by archives and time period "Last seven days"
  When I click the link "Archives"
  Then I should see all hits with an archive status for the Attorney General's office in descending count order
  When I filter by the date period "Last seven days"
  Then I should see an archives graph showing a grey trend line with 2 points
  And the period "Last seven days" should be selected

Scenario: Hits exist and can be filtered by redirects and time period "Last 30 days"
  When I click the link "Redirects"
  Then I should see all hits with a redirect status for the Attorney General's office in descending count order
  And I should see a redirects graph showing a green trend line
  When I filter by the date period "Last 30 days"
  Then I should see an redirects graph showing a green trend line with 2 points
  And the period "Last 30 days" should be selected

Scenario: Hits exist and can be filtered by other statuses
  When I click the link "Other"
  Then I should see all hits with an other status for the Attorney General's office in descending count order
  And I should see an other graph showing a grey trend line

Scenario: There are multiple pages for a category
  Given the hits page size is 11
  And there are at least two pages of error hits
  When I click the link "Errors"
  And I go to page 2
  Then I should not see a graph

Scenario: No hits exist at all
  Given no hits exist for the Attorney General's office site
  When I visit the associated organisation
  And I click the link "Hits Summary"
  Then I should not see a graph
  And I should see "There are no known hits for the ago summary yet"
  When I click the link "Errors"
  Then I should see "There are no errors for ago yet"
  And I should not see a graph
  When I filter by the date period "Last seven days"
  Then I should see "There are no errors for ago in this time period"
