Feature: Edit a site's mapping
  As a GDS user,
  I would like to edit a bad mapping
  so that the mapping begins to send people to the right place

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And an archive mapping exists for the bis site with the path /about
    And I visit the path /sites/bis/mappings?fake_param=1
    And I go to edit the first mapping

  Scenario: Looking at the example URL
    Then I should see "http://bis.gov.uk/about"
    And I should see "http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120816224015/http://bis.gov.uk/about"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Editing a site mapping that is a redirect
    When I make the mapping a redirect to https://a.gov.uk/new-url
    Then I should see redirect fields
    But I should not see archive fields
    When I save the mapping
    Then I should be returned to the mappings list I was on
    And I should see an open modal window
    And I should see "Mapping saved" in the modal window
    And I should see a table with 1 saved mapping in the modal
    And I should see "/about" in the modal window

  @javascript
  Scenario: Editing a site mapping that is an archive
    When I make the mapping an archive
    Then I should not see redirect fields
    But I should see archive fields

  @javascript
  Scenario: Adding an alternative archive URL
    When I click the link "Use an alternative"
    Then I should see the National Archives link replaced with an alternative National Archives field
    When I enter an archive URL but then click "Cancel"
    Then I should see the National Archives link again
    When I click the link "Use an alternative"
    Then the archive URL field should be empty

  @javascript
  Scenario: Adding a suggested URL
    When I click the link "Suggest a private sector URL"
    Then I should see the link replaced with a suggested URL field

  @javascript
  Scenario: Editing a site mapping that is unresolved
    When I make the mapping unresolved
    Then I should not see redirect fields
    And I should not see archive fields
    But I should see unresolved fields

  Scenario: Editing a mapping with invalid values
    When I make the mapping a redirect to http:////not-a-url
    And I save the mapping
    Then I should still be editing a mapping
    And I should see "New URL is not a URL"

  @allow-rescue
  Scenario: Visit the page of an non-existent mapping
    And I visit the path /sites/bis/mappings/123456789/edit
    Then I should see our custom 404 page

  @javascript
  Scenario: Jumping to a site mapping
    When I visit the path /sites/bis
    And I jump to the mapping "http://bis.gov.uk/about"
    Then I should see "Edit mapping"
