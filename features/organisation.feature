Feature: View organisation
  As a GDS User
  I want to see all the sites that belong to an organisation on a page
  so that I can work on their mappings

  Scenario: Visit an organisation page
    Given I have logged in as an admin
    And there is a bis organisation named UK Atomic Energy Authority abbreviated ukaea with these sites:
      | abbr       | homepage                                                               |
      | bis_ukaea  | https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority |
    When I visit the path /organisations/ukaea
    Then I should see the header "UK Atomic Energy Authority"
    And I should see that this organisation is an executive non-departmental public body of its parent
    And I should see links to all this organisation's sites and homepages

  Scenario: I can edit an organisation
    Given I have logged in as a member of DCLG
    When I visit the path /organisations/dclg
    Then I should see "You have permission to edit site mappings for Department for Communities and Local Government"
