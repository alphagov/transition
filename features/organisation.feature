Feature: View organisation
  As a GDS User
  I want to see all the sites that belong to an organisation on a page
  so that I can work on their mappings

  Scenario: Visit an organisation page
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And there is a bis organisation named UK Atomic Energy Authority abbreviated ukaea with these sites:
      | abbr       | homepage                                                               | default_host     |
      | bis_ukaea  | https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority | www.ukaea.gov.uk |
    When I visit the path /organisations/ukaea
    Then I should see the header "UK Atomic Energy Authority"
    And I should see that this organisation is an executive non-departmental public body of its parent
    And I should see links to all this organisation's sites
    And I should see all the old homepages for the sites of the given organisation

  Scenario: Organisation page with sites in each transition state
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And there is an organisation with the whitehall_slug "ukaea"
    And the organisation has a site with a host with a GOV.UK cname
    And the organisation has a site with a host with a third-party cname
    And the organisation has a site with a special redirect strategy of "via_aka"
    And the organisation has a site with a special redirect strategy of "supplier"
    When I visit the path /organisations/ukaea
    Then I should see "Live"
    And I should see "Pre-transition"
    And I should see "Indeterminate"
    And there should be a tooltip which includes "external supplier"
    And there should be a tooltip which includes "partially redirected"

  Scenario: An organisation being trusted by another to edit its mappings
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And an organisation is trusted to edit the mappings of another organisation's site
    And that organisation also has its own site
    When I visit the organisation's page
    Then I should see the site that the organisation is trusted to edit
    And I should see the organisation's own site

  @javascript
  Scenario: Filter the list of sites
    Given I have logged in as a GDS Editor
    And there is a bis organisation named Companies House abbreviated companies-house with these sites:
      | abbr             | homepage                                                    | default_host           |
      | companies        | https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house | companies.gov.uk       |
      | companies_welsh  | https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house | companies_welsh.gov.uk |
    When I visit the path /organisations/companies-house
    And I filter sites by "welsh"
    Then I should see a sites table with 1 row
    And I should see "companies_welsh.gov.uk"
    But I should not see "companies.gov.uk"

  @allow-rescue
  Scenario: Visit the page of an non-existent organisation
