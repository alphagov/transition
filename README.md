# Transition

Rails app for managing the transition of websites to GOV.UK. Specifically, it's for the production of and handling
of mappings for use with [Bouncer](https://github.com/alphagov/bouncer).

## Style guide

Available at /style, the guide documents how transition is using bootstrap, where the app has diverged from default
styles and any custom styles needed to fill in the gaps.
